Brief:

The payload is capable of the following:
- Screen viewing
- HID control (mouse and keyboard)
- Changing wallpaper (xD)
- Remote shutdown/restart
- Sending Notification
- Opening a URL
- Remote Command line 
- Text to speech [In case you wanna send a creepy message and spook the victim out; efective 99.9% of the time]
